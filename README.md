# Autonmous-Pick-and-Drop-of-Golf-Balls-using-Autonomous-Mobile-Robot-with-Manipulator-Arm

We are tasked with commanding an Autonomous Mobile Robot (AMR) equipped with a Manipulator Arm to pick up a specific golf ball (either red or blue) and place it into a mug. This involves directing the robot to locate and identify the golf balls using its onboard sensors or vision system. Once identified, the Manipulator Arm will carefully grasp the selected ball and transport it to the designated location of the mug. The robot will then release the ball into the mug, completing the task.
